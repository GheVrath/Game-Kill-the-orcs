Required Java version is at least 21.

This is a simple 2D game with three playable player classes: warrior, mage, or agent.
It mainly focuses on walking on the map and killing randomly spawning orcs, nothing
that would keep interest for more than a few minutes.

It has basic settings functionality like FPS control, language, and texture quality,
along with some cheats.

The application uses lightweight virtual threads introduced in Java 21.
It was written using IntelliJ IDEA. Some images were generated with AI Stable Diffusion
and hand-edited. Sprite sheets were animated using the Unity3D sprite editor.

The application was created when I had no idea about clean coding and didn't expect to
make that much functionality. It was meant only for simple character following the cursor,
but it went too far. That's the reason why I'd rather not post messy source code.
